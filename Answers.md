1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React is a popular UI library that is used to create complex UIs. It reduces everything to components and allows for props, decoupling the data from the visual elements.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

    To think in react means to consider apps as components, different parts with their unique, and ideally, sole, functions coming together to make an app. It is the design philosophy of the separation of concerns.

3. Describe state.

    State is really just another name for data, at a certain point in time. The state can change.

4. Describe props.

    Props are helper objects. They pass states from one component to another. They are also read-only.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. To sync effects, we use the effect hook (useEffect()).
